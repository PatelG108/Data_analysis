## About the Project

This project aims to analyze a dataset of **used cars** to:
- Understand price distribution
- Explore how factors like brand, year, fuel type, and mileage impact pricing
- Identify trends and outliers
- Create interactive and static visualizations for better storytelling

1. What is the average selling price of used cars by brand?
2. How many cars are available per year?
3. What is the average mileage (kmpl/km/kg) by fuel type?
4. What is the distribution of cars by transmission type?
5. Which owner type offers the most cars, and what's the average selling price?
6. Which year has the highest average selling price?
7. What is the relationship between engine size (binned) and price ?
